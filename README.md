# Restaurant Reviews Stage1

This project is part of the **Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree course**. The starter code is provided by Udacity. The project's goal is to convert a static webpage to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also a service worker is required for this project to create a seamless offline experience for users.
## Live Version

you can find a live version of the project [here](https://ecommsupports.com/demo/RestaurantReviews/)

## Installation

1. Download/clone this repository https://github.com/wwwgjhxx/Restaurant-Reviews-Stage1.git
2. Open index.html in the VSC code editor
3. Run "Open with Live Server" in the editor (You might need to install live server first in your editor)

By default, the live server uses port 5500. If you like to use other server software, please configure the server to listen to port 5500.  

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` in **main.js** and **restaurant_info.js** with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
